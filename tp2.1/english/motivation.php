        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp Trained as a 3 + 2 system engineer, I have a closer approach to France. I learned French from the first year of university, I followed specialty courses taught in French by French teachers, I was also able to get to know French engineering schools better and discover French culture in the French teachers' course. Thanks to this particular model of education, I have acquired a solid knowledge base and an open vision on the international scene.
        </p>
        <h2>objectifs</h2>
        <p>&nbsp&nbspTo achieve my goals, I am planning a continuation of engineering training in France. The force of French technological innovation is very strong in the world and French education in this field is also well known. Training in engineering schools will allow us to acquire specialized knowledge, practical skills and management skills and will help us to become competitive talents. The IMT schools, which are among the first in France, offer rich, high-quality training. The abilities that I could acquire through your training such as in-depth knowledge, innovative spirit, professional skills as well as your rich educational resources, your alumni network and your cooperation with many companies will help me achieve my goals. .
